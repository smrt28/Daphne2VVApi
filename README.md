This is nodejs api used to control 2VV Daphne ventialtion system.

The company refuset to provide me with the API docs, so this has been made by
reverse-engineering the Android application comunication with the 2VV unit.

It seems, the software in Daphne and the Android application are both buggy
like hell!
